                It was a chilly autumn night in a crowded grass field under the stars,
                where Martina and Michael first met. For one of the last activities of
                UCSD Warren College's Freshman Orientation, a couple hundred unsuspecting, fledgling Tritons
                found themselves being asked to participate in a group square dancing session.
                Two shamelessly enthusiastic kids ended up in the same fateful square,
                and, in the midst of frenzied fiddling and a flurry of feet, couldn't help but catch each others' attention.

                Martina and Michael (M&M) spent their first two years together exploring everything UCSD had to offer.
                Given the massive size of the campus, Martina could often be seen zooming around on her
                pink beach cruiser named "Jet", and Michael zig-zagging through crowds on his trusty longboard "Aurora".
                With their chosen steeds, M&M spent every day traversing the campus hills together to get to classes,
                events, and hangouts. Lucky for them, all the exercise helped keep the infamous "Freshman 15" at bay.

                Focusing more on classes and exams is a natural part of reaching junior and senior-status in college,
                but a bit of focus never dulled a true sense of fun and adventure. Since they now knew UCSD like the back of their hands,
                M&M decided to extend their boundaries a bit - Tzu Ching volunteer events brought them to
                different campuses like USC and UC Irvine, while dates had them
                exploring Julian, LA, and Hollywood. A frequent craving for sweets
                also often led them off-campus to Cheesecake Factory, to buy a slice of (or sometimes a whole...) Godiva Cheescake.

                Trips to scorching Dallas and breezy Catalina Island made 2012 very special for M&M, but of course,
                their graduation from UCSD stands out as the defining event of the year.
                The late-night study sessions fueled by hot cocoa,
                the early morning shoulder-to-shoulder bus rides to and from campus,
                the constant switching back and forth in classes between taking notes and browsing Facebook, and
                the excitement of waiting in line for crêpes made by the friendly French woman at the weekly Farmer's Market
                would all become memories of an era past.
                With purple leis draping down the front of their black gowns and a relationship four-years-strong,
                Martina and Michael bid UCSD farewell at its 2012 graduation ceremony and, together, began their
                post-college lives.

                The sky is no limit with M&M. In 2013, a fearless freefaller convinced her boyfriend to join her
                for a nice, quick drop out of a plane. Although skydiving had never been something Michael imagined
                attempting before, the sparkle in Martina's eyes and the promise of a memorable birthday experience
                eventually convinced him to strap on a parachute and take the leap of faith. After about five minutes later
                of high-altitude hysteria, Michael met with Martina back on Earth
                and hugged her like only a man with a newfound appreciation for solid ground could.

                Absence makes the heart grow fonder, or at least Michael and Martina liked to think, as a solo Martina headed north
                to San Dimas for a year to take on a new job. Suddenly, San Diego had gone from being home sweet home to a weekend
                getaway spot, which helped Martina realize more than ever just how much she loved America's Finest City.
                While fending for himself in San Diego, and without his better half to set him straight, some of Michael's
                habits started to revert to those of a college student -
                burritos for dinner, sleep schedules revolving around how many episodes of the Walking Dead he had
                left to watch, and afternoons spent on the sandy shores of La Jolla as a beach bum - being bummed out that Martina wasn't around.

                Together with their two previous (and practically-family) apartmentmates Michael and My, Martina and Michael
                (yes, we know that's a lot of M's) moved into a quaint little San Diego townhouse - the first place ever that
                they could officially call their own! Tall, vibrant plants and palm trees cover the house's front door in shade, which provided
                much-needed relief from the sun as the newest residents tirelessly carried moving boxes in. With freshly painted walls,
                newly purchased furniture, and even a small garden in the balcony to tend to, M&M had taken a big step forward into adulthood

                "I just got a phone call from...Marvel!" "What?" "They offered me a position!" "What??" "It's...in New York!" "WHAT?!?"
                When Martina broke the news about the career opportunity to Michael, he, and subsequently both of
                the couple's families, was shocked by the idea that Martina might spend a year or more making it in Manhattan. But surprise quickly
                turned to steadfast support, and Martina soon after set off to write a defining chapter of her life. Making the most of the experience,
                she spent afternoons and weekends sketching all the sights, collected free comic books from work, visited every museum she could,
                and attended star-studded Marvel movie premieres. After a year of adventures in New York, she hung up the cape and headed back to home base.

                When Martina returned from New York, she was more than happy to accept an invitation to a Friday dinner and
                catch-up session with Michael and some friends. It felt like a decade since she had been able
                to get dressed up, drive in a car, and have a meal with real-deal San Diegans.
                She soon discovered upon arriving, however, that the San Diego Wine and Culinary Center's
                "special dinner event" she had been expecting to attend was in reality a private affair meant only for her,
                and her soon-to-be fiancé. Michael had secretly taken the day off from work to borrow the location's kitchens,
                prepare a seven-course dinner, and make sure the privately-reserved space was blanketed in candles and music.
                With steeled nerves and ring at the ready, Michael humbly got down on one knee and asked the inevitable question.
                She said yes!

                On January 23rd (1-2-3!) with their families and two housemates as joyful witnesses,
                M&M made a trip to a courthouse in San Marcos and finally tied a knot eight years in the making.
                In place of the traditional wedding ceremony, Martina and Michael decided to take a two-week "wedding tour"
                to Japan, Taiwan, and Hawaii, during which they were able to visit and celebrate with
                many friends and family as part of the trip itself. M&M would say they lead a very fulfilling
                married life together. At the time of writing: they most enjoy spending their days paddling out together
                to catch friendly waves at both new and favorite surf spots, taking it easy at home, a cafe, or Barnes and
                Noble and working on their personal projects, and always finding some time to discover new events, restaurants,
                sights and beaches in their home of San Diego. M&M's wedding marked the end of one adventure; they're now looking forward to the next!
